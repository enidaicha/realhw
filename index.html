            <h2>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Season 7. Episode 1 </h2>

			<p>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills are back in Season 7. The one casting change was the replacement of Yolanda Hadid by Dorit Kemsley. The other cast members (ordered by favorite to least favorite) are the same: Lisa Vanderpump, Erika Girardi, Kyle Richards, Lisa Rinna, and Eileen Davidson. <p>


			<h3>This season on…</h3>
			<p>The season teaser before the first episode first began with scenes of the housewives having a great time together. Eileen says with amazement, “This is living on another level.”  Kyle exclaims, “This is the way hanging out with girlfriends should be!” </p>


			<p>The teaser then turns into hurled insults and drama. It is hinted at that Vanderpump will try to mend fences with Rinna and Eileen, but still acknowledges that they are probably still not her friends when she says: “Nothing bothers your enemies more than forgiving them.” It looks like there will be drama between Kyle and Rinna this season. She says that, “Lisa Rinna needs to sew her fucking mouth shut.” I wonder if their grudge is influenced by Rinna’s fights with Kyle’s sister Kim, two seasons ago. </p>


			<h3>My predictions…</h3>
			<p>The drama will center mainly around Lisa Rinna; her main focus will be on Kyle and Erika. Eileen will be involved in the drama from the background: she will encourage Rinna to "stand up for herself" and fight, and she will also try to make Vanderpump a central focus collective ire. I predict Lisa won't allow the others to gang up on her this time. She will not be involved in most of the drama and will instead focus on her dogs and animal rights. There will also be some side-fighting between Erika and Dorit, the two youngest women on the show. </p>


			<h3>Taglines…</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>I may be two people, but I’m not two-faced - Erika</li>
				<li>The crown is heavy dahlings, so just leave it where it is - Vanderpump</li>
				<li>Don’t hustle the hustler - Lisa Rinna</li>
				<li>I speak no evil but I see and hear everything - Eileen</li>
				<li>When you’ve traveled the world, you can speak in any accent you want - Dorit</li>
				<li>I’m expert on luxury, and I can always spot a fake - Kyle</li>
			</ul>
			<p>First, Erika’s tagline makes no sense. </p>


			<p>Second, Andy said on an interview on the Bitch Sesh podcast, that all of Kyle’s taglines referenced Beverly Hills; he’s right. This is the first time it hasn’t. </p>
			<p>Here are her previous ones: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Season 1: “In a town full of phonies, I’m not afraid to be me.” </li>
				<li>Season 2: “I’m not the richest girl in Beverly Hills, but I am the luckiest.” </li>
				<li>Season 3: “I’m born and raised in Beverly Hills. This is my town.” 
				<li>Season 4: "I’m from this town. I know what’s real and I know what’s fake."</li>
				<li>Season 5: "Planes and yachts are nice, but my happiness starts at home."</li>
				<li>Season 6: "In Beverly Hills you can be anything, but it’s most important to be yourself." </li>				
			</ul>


			<h3>The episode…</h3>
			<h4>Kyle, Lisa, and Dorit </h4>
			<p>The first episode begins at Kyle’s house, where she’s wearing (gasp!) Birkenstocks. I hate Birkenstocks, but still the most appalling part of that scene to me is that she is wearing shoes inside her house. I digress. Kyle talks to Lisa on the phone about meeting her and the new housewife, Dorit, at Pump. Kyle says she knows who Dorit is through Boy George. Boy George is Dorit's permanent houseguest and Kyle and Boy George were on Celebrity Apprentice together. </p>

		    <h4>Erika </h4>
			<p>Erika's season debut is with her husband, Tom, at their house. He gives her a birthday present - a painting by one of his favorite painters, Marc Chagall. But lest you think he’s some kind of jerk for not getting her something she would actually like, he also got her a very expensive, tacky, large ring from Cartier. Also, she’s throwing herself a huge party replete with Pussy Control, whoever that is, and a bunch of nearly-naked ladies dancing on poles or whatever bullshit they always have at the RHOBH parties (now also Vanderpump Rules parties). I've begun to like Erika this episode. When Lisa asks her what she did to get her giant ring, she says, “I did what every woman does to get things - I’m good!” She doesn’t allow Vanderpump to demean her and her gift. </p>      

			<h4>Dorit </h4>
			<p>Dorit makes her appearance on the show during lunch at Pump with Vanderpump, Kyle, and their spouses. Dorit is married to PK. He has a talent management company that she helps with. They have two little kids - a 2-year-old and a four-month-old. I don’t remember a housewife with a baby this little. At lunch, they begin to talk about their trip to Dubai from the previous season. On this trip, Eileen and Rinna ganged up on Vanderpump, and she had a horrible time. Kyle says that she had a great time. Vanderpump says to her, “You’re evil,” in a joking way. But is she really joking? They seem to have a love-hate relationship, and Kyle takes a lot of jabs at her in this episode. </p>


			<h4>Rinna, Erika, and Kyle</h4>
			<p>Rinna's episode debut is at her house while her husband, Harry, gifts her a brand new Tesla with a bow on. (Are Birkenstock and Tesla sponsors of the show?) She talks about how she is so busy and so amazing because she does everything she does, with two teenage daughters.  “The life that I have and doing what I do…that’s why I don’t have time for a whole lot of bullshit right now,” she says. And she reminds us that she has two teenage daughters in two out of about five sentences. We know, girl, we know. Also, you look even stranger this season. </p>


			<p>Speaking of lips...oh wait...in the next scene, Erika, Kyle, and Eileen meet for lunch. I don't like Eileen. She is cold and uptight. This episode involves her heavily kissing Erika's ass. She tells the hostess at the restaurant where they meet, "I'm with that really awesome blonde woman." She alsos says in her confessional that Erika’s a real “girl’s girl” and that she is “larger than life.” I’m not sure what she’s getting out of all the flattery </p>


			<p>Before Kyle arrives, Erika and Eileen are deep in serious conversation. When Kyle gets there, she tries to lighten the mood with a stupid joke about forgetting her lip gloss. It falls flat and Eileen takes back the somber mood by saying they were talking about really serious stuff before she arrived. I find it hard to imagine a gathering that Eileen doesn't make tense. </p>


			<p>During lunch, Kyle brings the conversation back to Vanderpump. She asks Eileen, “Are you okay with Lisa now?” She says in her confessional that Vanderpump is more likely to mend fences with Rinna first because Rinna is easier to manipulate. I have the slightest inkling that not too deep down, Kyle enjoyed that all the girls ganged up on Vanderpump last season. Back at the lunch, Kyle says to Eilieen, “You will always be civil and nice. I know that about you." </p>
			<h4>The Party </h4>
			<p>The remainder of the episode provides more background of Dorit, and Erika’s party. Dorit is at her house with her two small kids and Boy George. Dorit says that Boy George is Uncle George in their house, and he’s a great houseguest although, “Diva does come out.” </p>


			<p>Rinna and Eileen, ever the single and fortified unit, travel as one to Erika's party. They both look like they are going to a cheap costume party, and Rinna’s face looks very botoxed and her lips look bigger. </p>


			<p>Erika continues to grow on me this episode, and I even like her song that she plays at her party. The party, of course, includes a lot of naked, dancing women. It seems to be going slowly until Vanderpump arrives, and all the drama -- aimed at her -- begins. </p>


			<p>Kyle takes more jabs at Vanderpump, when she highlights how old Ken is, joking that he didn’t have to go anywhere to get his Studio 54 outfit: he just went to his closet. Lisa, on the other hand, has not talked about Kyle at all. </p>


			<p>It looks like Rinna and Vanderpump are headed towards a reconciliation, and Eileen and Vanderpump are not. Vanderpump’s relationships with these two women will likely take different paths because Rinna is more laid back and Eileen is very uptight (oh, have I mentioned that yet?). Vanderpump approaches Rinna at the party and jokes wither. Rinna says, “Game on! See, this is what we’re good at. Taking the piss out of each other.” Eileen, on the other hand, is not one with which to be joked. Maybe this is standing up for herself, but maybe she shouldn’t be so defensive and guarded. Rinna just seems to be spouting a lot of platitudes she must have heard at a therapist, like “I’d rather be better than bitter,” and “I can’t control her behavior; I can only control mine.” </p>


			<p>Eileen continues to kiss Erika’ ass at the party. Her birthday gift is an appearance on the Young and the Restless and she says later at the party, “I adore her more everyday.” </p>


			<p>The episode ends with Eileen talking to Dorit. She then says without any evidence, “Maybe Lisa doesn’t like me talking to her friend.” It seems more likely that Eileen would flatter herself into thinking that, or that maybe she has discovered another way to attack and undermine Lisa. The episode closes with Lisa joining the group of girls late to dance, with a dramatic voiceover of her saying, “They would probably be happy if I wasn’t part of this circle of friends but no, I’m coming back: and I’m coming back stronger than ever.” </p>
