            <h2>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Season 7. Episode 1 </h2>

			<p>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills are back in Season 7. The one casting change was the replacement of Yolanda Hadid by Dorit Kemsley. The other cast members (ordered by favorite to least favorite) are the same: Lisa Vanderpump, Erika Girardi, Kyle Richards, Lisa Rinna, Eileen Davidson <p>


			<h3>This season on…</h3>
			<p>The season teaser at the beginning of the first episode first showed scenes of the cast members having a great time together. Eileen says with amazement, “This is living on another level.”  Kyle exclaims, “This is the way hanging out with girlfriends should be!” </p>


			<p>The teaser then turns into hurled insults and drama, of course without being explicit about any of it. It is hinted at that Lisa will at least try to mend fences after last season, but still acknowledges that she some aren’t her friends when she says: “Nothing bothers your enemies more than forgiving them.” It looks like Kyle and Rinna will be going at it this season. She says that, “Lisa Rinna needs to sew her fucking mouth shut.”  If they are feuding this season as is teased, is Kyle’s grudge influenced by Rinna’s gross behavior toward Kyle’s sister Kim, two seasons ago? It goes deeper, is all I’m saying, and because of that, it could be nastier. </p>


			<h3>My predictions…</h3>
			<p>My predictions are based on the teaser and knowledge of the show and the women on it from watching every single episode. The drama will center mainly around Lisa Rinna; her main focus will be on Kyle and Erika. Eileen will be involved in the drama from the background: she will be egging on Rinna and trying to bring Vanderpump as a central focus of ire, trying to make the women gang up on her again. But alas, I predict Lisa will fight against being ganged up on again this season, and she’ll mainly stay out of the fray, focusing on her dogs, and doggie rights. There will also be some side-fighting between Erika and Dorit, the two youngest women on the show. </p>


			<h3>Taglines…</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>I may be two people, but I’m not two-faced - Erika</li>
				<li>The crown is heavy dahlings, so just leave it where it is - Vanderpump</li>
				<li>Don’t hustle the hustler - Lisa Rinna</li>
				<li>I speak no evil but I see and hear everything - Eileen</li>
				<li>When you’ve traveled the world, you can speak in any accent you want - Dorit</li>
				<li>I’m expert on luxury, and I can always spot a fake - Kyle</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Erika’s tagline makes no sense. </p>


			<p>Andy said on an interview on the Bitch Sesh podcast, that all of Kyle’s taglines referenced Beverly Hills; he’s right. This is the first time it hasn’t. </p>
			<p>Here are her previous ones: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Season 1: “In a town full of phonies, I’m not afraid to be me.” </li>
				<li>Season 2: “I’m not the richest girl in Beverly Hills, but I am the luckiest.” </li>
				<li>Season 3: “I’m born and raised in Beverly Hills. This is my town.” 
				<li>Season 4: "I’m from this town. I know what’s real and I know what’s fake."</li>
				<li>Season 5: "Planes and yachts are nice, but my happiness starts at home."</li>
				<li>Season 6: "In Beverly Hills you can be anything, but it’s most important to be yourself." </li>				
			</ul>


			<h3>The episode…</h3>
			<h4>Kyle, Lisa, and Dorit </h4>
			<p>The first episode begins at Kyle’s house, where she’s wearing (gasp!) Birkenstocks. The most appalling part of that scene to me is that she is wearing shoes inside her house. We are wet up to meet Dorit. Kyle talks to Lisa on the phone about meeting her at Pump (where else!), with their spouses. And then, while Kyle might not have mentioned Beverly Hills in her tagline, she gets it in there in the season’s first season. She knows of Dorit because Boy George lives at her house, and she was on Celebrity Apprentice with him: “Everybody knows everybody in Beverly Hills,” she says. I love how Kyle really tries to make it seem like she knows all famous people, and Boy George just happens to be one of them. Also, Celebrity Apprentice - gross because Trump. Did she, like her niece, vote Trump? Is this why I’m starting to see her evil side? </p>


			<h4>Erika </h4>
			<p>Erika season debut is with her husband, Tom, at their home. He gives her a birthday present - a painting by one of his favorite painters, Marc Chagall. But lest you think he’s some kind of jerk for not getting her something she would actually like, he also got her a very expensive, tacky, large ring from Cartier. Also, she’s throwing herself a huge party replete with Pussy Control, whoever that is, and a bunch of nearly-naked ladies dancing on poles or whatever bullshit they always have at the RHOBH parties (now also Vanderpump Rules parties). I went the opposite way with Erika than I did with Kyle (and I think I’ll always love Lisa Vanderpump). Kyle, I started to hate. Erika, I began to like.  She says in a small clip, “I did what every woman does to get things - I’m good!” when Lisa asks her what she did to get her giant ring. She doesn’t go there with Lisa, and I like that subtle way in which she stopped any judgements and stood up for herself. </p>      

			<h4>Dorit </h4>
			<p>We then see Dorit for the first time, at lunch at Pump with Vanderpump, Kyle, and their spouses. Dorit is married to PK. He has a talent management company that she helps with. They have two little kids - a 2-year-old and a four-month-old. Dorit is not the youngest ever cast member, but I don’t remember one with a baby this little on any of the seasons (I also watch NYC and the OC). At lunch, they begin to talk about their trip to Dubai in the previous season. It was on this trip that Eileen and Rinna really ganged up on Vanderpump, and she had a horrible time. Kyle says that she had a great time on the trip. Vanderpump says to her, “You’re evil,” in a joking way. But is she really joking? They seem to have a love-hate relationship, and Kyle seems untrustworthy to me. </p>


			<h4>Rinna, Erika, and Kyle</h4>
			<p>Rinna then makes her appearance on the episode, standing in front of her house while her husband, Harry, drives up a brand new Tesla with a bow on it as a gift to her. So far the thing I think are being advertised on this show are Birkenstocks and Teslas. Lisa’s entrance was the worst. She talks about how she is so busy and so amazing because she does everything she does, with two teenage daughters.  “The life that I have and doing what I do…that’s why I don’t have time for a whole lot of bullshit right now,” she says. And she reminds us that she has two teenage daughters in two out of about five sentences. We know, girl, we know. Also, you’re looking even weirder this season. </p>


			<p>Speaking of lips...oh wait...in the next scene, Erika, Kyle, and Eileen meet for lunch. I’m glad that Eileen didn’t get her own solo season debut, because she is my least favorite one, and it makes me feel validated in that feeling. Every scene with Eileen in this episode seems to involve her major ass-kissing of Erika. She starts it off strong by telling the hostess at the restaurant that she’s with “that really awesome blonde woman” over there, referring to Erika. She goes on to say, in her confessional, that Erika’s a real “girl’s girl” and that she is “larger than life.” I’m not sure what she’s getting out of it, but it’s weird. </p>


			<p>Erika and Eileen talk very seriously about serious issues before Kyle arrives. When Kyle gets there, she tries to lighten the mood with a stupid joke about forgetting her lip gloss. It falls flat and Eileen takes back the somber mood by saying they were talking about really serious stuff before she arrived. It’s pretty clear to me that Eileen is really uptight and creates tense atmospheres around her. </p>


			<p>Kyle is supposed to be Lisa’s good friend, but I don’t really see that in this episode. She brings the conversation back to Lisa at some point during the lunch and asks, “Are you okay with Lisa now?” We then see Kyle’s confessional, where she says that Vanderpump is more likely to mend fences with Rinna first because Rinna is easier to manipulate. I have the slightest inkling that not too deep down, Kyle enjoyed that all the girls ganged up on Vanderpump last season. Back at the lunch, Kyle says to Eilieen, “You will always be civil and nice. I know that about you.” It looks like Kyle s taking Eileen’s side here and saying that Eileen doesn’t have to forgive Lisa but because she’s so “civil and nice,” she will pretend to. </p>
			<h4>The Party </h4>
			<p>The remainder of the episode provides more background of Dorit, and Erika’s party. Dorit is at her house with her two small kids and Boy George. Dorit says that Boy George is Uncle George in their house, and he’s a great houseguest although, “Diva does come out.” </p>


			<p>We then see preparations and traveling to Erika’s party, and then the party, place where the buds of drama are sewn. Rinna and Eileen, ever the single and fortified unit, travel as one to the party. They both look like they are going to a crappy costume party, and Rinna’s face looks very botoxed and her lips look bigger. </p>


			<p>Erika continues to grow on my this episode, and I even liked her song that she plays at her party. The party, of course, includes a lot of naked, dancing women. It seems to be going slowly until Vanderpump arrives, and all the drama -- aimed at her -- begins. </p>


			<p>We see Kyle taking jabs, again, at Vanderpump, when she highlights how old Ken is, joking that he didn’t have to go anywhere to get his Studio 54 outfit: he just went to his closet. True or not, she’s been nothing but mean this episode, and LIsa hasn’t said a word about her or jabbed her directly. </p>


			<p>It looks like Rinna and Vanderpump are headed towards a reconciliation, and Eileen and Vanderpump are not. Vanderpump’s relationships with these two women take different paths because Rinna is more laid back and Eileen is very uptight. After Vanderpump approaches Rinna and makes a slightly jabby reference to last season, Rinna says, “Game on! See, this is what we’re good at. Taking the piss out of each other.” Eileen, on the other hand, is not one with which to be joked. Maybe this is standing up for herself, but maybe she shouldn’t be so defensive and guarded. Or maybe, as Rinna is apparently doing lots of, she should go to therapy, as she had mentioned she was considering during her earlier lunch with Erika and Kyle. Rinna just seems to be spouting a lot of platitudes she must have heard at a therapist, like “I’d rather be better than bitter,” and “I can’t control her behavior; I can only control mine.” </p>


			<p>Eileen continues to kiss Erika’ ass at the party. Her birthday gift is an appearance on the Young and the Restless and she says later at the party, “I adore her more everyday.” </p>


			<p>The episode ends with Eileen talking to Dorit. Vanderpump leaves an encounter with Eileen, and she is left standing there with Dorit. She then says, without what seems to be any evidence, “Maybe Lisa doesn’t like me talking to her friend.” It seems more likely that Eileen would flatter herself into thinking that, or that maybe she has discovered another way to attack and undermine Lisa. The episode closes with Lisa joining the group of girls late to dance, with a dramatic voiceover of her saying, “They would probably be happy if I wasn’t part of this circle of friends but no, I’m coming back: and I’m coming back stronger than ever.” </p>
